Given a binary tree consisting of nodes with positive integer values, write a method - max_sum_path that returns the maximum sum of data values obtained by traversing nodes along a path between any 2 nodes of the tree. The path must originate and terminate at 2 different nodes of the tree, and the maximum sum is obtained by summing all the data values of the nodes traversed along this path.
